# LeetCode Progress Tracker

This repository is a personal log of my progress on LeetCode as I practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I'm sharing it publicly to stay accountable, stay consistent, and track how far I’ve come.

## 🎯 Goal

Solve problems regularly to build strong problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## 🗃️ Folder Structure

Problems are organized by topic or difficulty:

    leetcode-solutions/
    ├── arrays/
    │ ├── two-sum.cpp
    │ └── best-time-to-buy-stock.cpp
    ├── strings/
    │ └── valid-palindrome.cpp
    ├── trees/
    │ └── invert-binary-tree.cpp

Each file is named after the problem, and includes a clean solution with comments when needed.

## 🔁 Update Frequency

I add solutions as I solve them — usually a few times a week. No specific number goal, just steady progress.

## 📌 Note

This repo is **not** meant to show off optimal solutions. It's just a log of my journey and growth in DSA.
